# Spell-Correction

This is link for the tkinter editor. https://www.studytonight.com/tkinter/text-editor-application-using-tkinter

My idea is to have users type or upload a file into the text editor, then your algorithm can run spell correction and detection on the words. We can also do it live while the user types which is nice.

Only thing im confused on is how to implement the spell correction cause in the project description its very vague and does not mention that we cant use libraries
