# How to Use

1. To run this application clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/Platense61/Spell-Correction.git```  

2. Once cloned, open the folder and run the script using ```python project3.py```  

3. From here you will see a tkinter UI pop up, you can now enter text into the text box, incorrect spellings will be underlined with a black underline and a word correction function will be ran with the output on the command line

4. When the application is running there is an open button located on the right hand side. When clicked it will open a file explorer where you can navigate to various files. For testing purposes it is recommended to open aspell.dat, which is located in ```data/raw/incorrect_words/aspell.dat```. This will then trigger our spell correction to run on a bunch of misspelled words for testing purposes.  

## Notes

aspell.dat was used in the training data set
